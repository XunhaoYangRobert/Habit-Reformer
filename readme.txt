Technical summary
The habit reformer aims to solve the nuisances of our unhealthy habit that potentially influences our life quality and fitness. 
We mainly employ wearable device that is light enough and convenient for users to use. Through these wearable device like crossed-leg eavesdropper, we help consumers get rid of some unhealthy habit. Our wearable devices mainly help consumers realize the unintentional move or posture and correct it. 
The crossed-leg eavesdropper(CLE), our very first prototype, is a sticker-like device which can detect users¡¯ current leg condition to see whether they are doing crossed-legs. The CLE¡¯s sticker is a changeable Velcro that can stick on users¡¯ pants. Then the CLE is able to detect the relative position and pressure of two legs and judge whether the consumer is crossing their legs. 
As the CLE detects that the user is crossing their legs, the CLE will vibrate to make the user aware and put down their legs. Users can change the mode in the Settings of APP if they consider vibration is not an effective alarming way, a little electricity discharge, for example. 
We also have an application on Android that can gather data from wearable device and analyze it. It can tell you whether your habit is already healthy, or need to make an effort. The app make decision through daily detection. The data transits from device to phone through Bluetooth. 
The application records the data from hardware device. In the APP users are able to find the summary data of a week or a month. And the APP will also provide analysis. For example, list out the time user most likely to cross the legs in a day, a week and a month. 
In the second stage of our development, the consumer group is large enough and our products are diverse. Then, our products pursues to create a community where people care their health from daily habits. People in the community share thoughts and healthy experience not limited by the products on our application. The users are required to register accounts where they can record the data beyond one phone to a reachable account. During the first login, the App will require a series of information from users and scan the users¡¯ body to find some physical posture problem like uneven shoulder. Later the APP will provide you some articles about how to solve your problem and recommend the products that fit the condition.
